# Getting Started

This document contains instructions to get a fully working development environment for running this repo.


## 1. pyenv

Install here: [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macos]

Configure by adding the following to your `~/.zshrc` or equivalent:

```sh
# Pyenv environment variables
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"

# Pyenv initialization
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Basic usage:

```sh
# Check Python versions
pyenv install --list

# Install the Python version defined in this repo
pyenv install $(cat .python-version)

# See installed Python versions
pyenv versions
```


## 2. [pyenv-virtualenvwrapper](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper)

```sh
# Install with homebrew (recommended if you installed pyenv with homebrew)
brew install pyenv-virtualenvwrapper
```

Configure by adding the following to your `~/.zshrc` or equivalent:

```sh
# pyenv-virtualenvwrapper
export PYENV_VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PREFER_PYVENV="true"
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/code  # <- change this to wherever you store your repos
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=$HOME/.pyenv/shims/python
pyenv virtualenvwrapper_lazy
```

Test everything is working by opening a new shell (e.g. new Terminal window):

```sh
# Change to the Python version you just installed
pyenv shell $(cat .python-version)
# This only needs to be run once after installing a new Python version through pyenv
# in order to initialise virtualenvwrapper for this Python version
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install virtualenvwrapper
pyenv virtualenvwrapper_lazy

# Create test virtualenv (if this doesn't work, try sourcing ~/.zshrc or opening new shell)
mkvirtualenv venv_test
which python
python -V

# Deactivate & remove test virtualenv
deactivate
rmvirtualenv venv_test
```


## 3. Get the repo & initialise the repo environment

⚠️ N.B. You should replace `REPO_GIT_URL` here with your actual URL to your GitHub repo.

```sh
git clone ${REPO_GIT_URL}
pyenv shell $(cat .python-version)

# Make a new virtual environment using the Python version & environment name specified in the repo
mkvirtualenv -p python$(cat .python-version) $(cat .venv)
python -V  # check this is the correct version of Python
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```


## 4. Install Python requirements into the virtual environment using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Install Poetry onto your system by following the instructions here: [https://python-poetry.org/docs/]

Note that Poetry "lives" outside of project/environment, and if you follow the recommended install
process it will be installed isolated from the rest of your system.

```sh
# Update Poetry regularly as you would any other system-level tool. Poetry is environment agnostic,
# it doesn't matter if you run this command inside/outside the virtualenv.
poetry self update

# This command should be run inside the virtualenv.
poetry install --no-root --sync
```


## 5. [zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv](https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv)

Download with `git clone "https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv.git" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/autoswitch_virtualenv"`

Configure by adding the following to your `~/.zshrc` or equivalent:

```sh
# Find line containing plugins=(git) and replace with below
plugins=(git autoswitch_virtualenv)
```

Check it's working by cd-ing into & out of the repo. The environment should load & unload respectively.


## 6. Install [Poetry Up](https://github.com/MousaZeidBaker/poetry-plugin-up)

This is a useful Poetry plugin that updates dependencies and bumps their versions in the
pyproject.toml file. The version constraints are respected, unless the `--latest` flag is passed, in
which case dependencies are updated to latest available compatible versions.

```sh
# Installation
poetry self add poetry-plugin-up

# Usage
poetry up
poetry up --latest
```


## 7. Add secrets into .env

  - Run `cp .env.template .env` and update the secrets.
  - [Install direnv](https://direnv.net/) to autoload environment variables specified in `.env`
  - Run `direnv allow` to authorise direnv to load the secrets from `.env` into the environment
    (these will unload when you `cd` out of the repo; note that you will need to re-run this
    command whenever you change `.env`)


## 8. Initialise the `detect-secrets` pre-commit hook

We use [`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) to check that no secrets are
accidentally committed. Please read [docs/detect_secrets.md](docs/detect_secrets.md) for more information.


```shell
# Generate a baseline
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline

# You may want to check/amend the exclusions in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` e.g.
detect-secrets --verbose scan \
    --exclude-files 'poetry\.lock' \
    --exclude-files '\.secrets\.baseline' \
    --exclude-files '\.env\.template' \
    --exclude-secrets 'password|ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE|INSERT_API_KEY_HERE' \
    --exclude-lines 'integrity=*sha' \
    > .secrets.baseline

# Audit the generated baseline
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```

When you run this command, you'll enter an interactive console. This will present you with a list
of high-entropy string and/or anything which could be a secret. It will then ask you to verify
whether this is the case. This allows the hook to remember false positives in the future, and alert
you to new secrets.


## 9. Project-specific setup

Please check [docs/project_specific_setup.md](docs/project_specific_setup.md) for further instructions.
